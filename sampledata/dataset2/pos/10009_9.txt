When I first first first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence. It's this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right now!!<br /><br />S~
